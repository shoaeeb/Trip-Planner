## Trip Planner

**_Requirements_**

- As a user, I should be able to add destinations. I should be able to do this by using a form, click on a map (with an API call), or other approaches included.
- As a user, I should be able to rearrange the order of my destinations.
- As a user, I’d like to be able to see my destinations on a map.
- As a user, I’d like to be able to see information about the distance and journey time between each destination.
- As a user, I’d like to be able to see summary data about my entire journey. This could include the total time, distance and, for extra points, even the fuel needed.
- As a user, I’d like my data to be stored in my browser’s local storage so I can navigate away from this page and come back with the data still there.

**_For Extra Challenge:_**
-Display points of interest between each destination This can be achieved by either looking at popular attractions or asking the user about their interests.
-For longer parts of the journey, suggest where users might take shortstops (i.e.hotels and their rates).
-Use the dates of the road trip and suggest events of interest that are on the path.
